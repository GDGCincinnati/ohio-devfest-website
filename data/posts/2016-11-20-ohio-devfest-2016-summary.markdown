The event took place on Saturday, November 19, 2016 at Tangeman University Center on the University of Cincinnati's campus.
We had 3 tracks with 12 speakers from all over the US and Canada who spoke on a variety of topics including Android, Firebase, Angular, Retrofit, Realm DB, Daydream, game development, continuous integration, machine learning, and the modern semantic web. 

The morning started with breakfast as attendees and speakers arrived and picked up their Ohio DevFest t-shirts and swag. Several of our partners setup elaborate booths to show off their company and technology as well as provide information for would-be job seekers.

The [Krush](https://www.krush.com) team spared no expense for their booth. It included posters displaying their technologies and products and large soda bar with a frozen drink machine that dispenses sweet or tart refreshment depending on the expression on your face!

Google Daydream team member, [Shanee Nishry](https://twitter.com/lunarsong), brought a couple of the new Google Daydream rigs for attendees to try out. Thanks Shanee, that was great fun!

After the keynote, Googler [Shanee Nishry](https://twitter.com/lunarsong) told us what it was like on the Daydream team at Google. GDG Program Manager, [Martin Omander](https://plus.google.com/+MartinOmander) then told us how Firebase game programming made him a better dad.

We then broke for lunch which gave attendees another chance to socialize and network and check out all the partner booths.

Then we wrapped up and many of our attendees joined us at [Rhinegeist Brewery](https://www.rhinegeist.com) for pizza, drinks, more socializing, and maybe a cornhole game or two.

We really couldn't expect a better result for our first DevFest. The speakers were excellent, the venue was a great place, and you the attendees were [awesome](/cod/). I can't wait until next year! See you next year in Columbus for [Ohio DevFest 2017]()!
