The fun isn't over just because all the talks are complete!

Ohio DevFest goers are invited to [Zaftig Brewing Co.](https://www.drinkzaftig.com/) following the conference. Two drink tickets are included for those who are old enough and interested in enjoying alcoholic beverages. If that isn't your thing not to worry -  softdrinks will be available as well! In addition to drinks, pizza will be provided and the [Tennessee Pit](https://www.facebook.com/tennesseepit/) foodtruck will be onsite for additional food options.

Not hungry or thirsty? Stop over anyway to play darts and boardgames, and generally have a good time meeting other conference attendees! Zaftig has several games available, but also feel free to bring your own!
