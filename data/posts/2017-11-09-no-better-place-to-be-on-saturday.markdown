So give me a just a minute to tell you that there is no better place to spend your Saturday November 18th than Ohio DevFest.

We are down to about one week away from Ohio DevFest (Saturday Nov 18 in Westerville, OH at The Point @ Otterbein).  We’ve passed 150 tickets sold and coming up quickly on our 200 maximum; so don’t delay.  

Here's what all you get for your $50 admission ($30 for students):
- Great speakers covering AI/ML, Android, Google Cloud and more.
- OhioDevFest 2017 T-Shirt
- Swag bag and stickers galore
- Duck Donuts and Coffee (or milk or OJ) for breakfast
- Fusian Sushi for lunch (PBJ rolls for those that don’t want seafood)
- Donatos pizza and Zaftig beer for dinner after party
